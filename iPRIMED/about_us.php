        <p class="paral pb-0"> It all started in 2009 with a small set up in Bangalore! We ventured into the relatively
            unchartered and
            complex
            territory of enhancing the employability of India’s youth and facilitating them into meaningful and
            well-paying
            jobs!</p>
        <p class="paral pt-3"> We primarily focused (and still do) on white collared jobs in the Tech and Tech enabled
            Services
            industry.
            Our
            target segment was (and continues to be) students from Tier 2 and Tier 3 towns and mostly from a lower
            socio-economic strata who gravitate to large cities like Bangalore in the quest of making an entry into the
            then
            glamorous IT industry! These entry level jobs were then aspirational (and continues to be) for our target
            segment.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="parallax-window" data-parallax="scroll" data-image-src="Assets/Images/about/skills.jpg"></div>
    <div class="container">
        <p class="paral"> However, they lacked the technical and behavioral skills
            required
            for the jobs which is where we
            came
            in!
            Leveraging our unique transformation model (under patent), we have been able to source, profile, train
            and
            place
            25,000+ graduates and engineers from our target segment into jobs. We have helped change their families
            and
            their
            lives forever! Today, our alumni are working across the globe and in companies like Microsoft, IBM,
            Accenture,
            Capgemini, HPE, DXC, Dell, Indian Tier 1 and 2 IT companies, GICs like Manhattan Associates,
            CenturyLink,
            Honeywell,
            ANZ, Wells Fargo etc. Our operations very soon went beyond Bangalore and covered many Tier 1 and Tier 2
            cities!
            For
            our CSR programs, we have pretty much traversed the lengths and breadths of India!

        <p class="paral">
            Over the course of this journey, we have branched off into other related areas of the Talent Supply
            Chain
            and
            today
            cover a wide spectrum of offerings cutting across Recruitment, Training and Content & Tech areas. We
            have
            tied
            up
            with partners in the UK and are delivering some of our services in the UK as well as bringing some of
            our
            partner’s
            services to the doorsteps of our clients. Our online learning offerings have taken our footprint into
            many
            countries
            – US, Brazil, Guatemala, Poland, UK, UAE, ANZ, Nigeria and China.
            Since 2013, we have invested heavily in our Digital Transformation and today most of our operations can
            run
            digitally! This has helped create a scalable and cost effective solution.
