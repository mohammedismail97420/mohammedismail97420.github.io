                        <p>It was 2008. The financial meltdown of 2008/9 was nowhere on the horizon. Offshoring was at
                            its peak. At
                            a tavern in
                            the mid west, I was having an engaging conversation with the CFO of a neo age telecom
                            operator, on "India
                            rising"
                            visavis the despondency in the US! An interesting evening, but what didn't strike me then
                            but it does
                            today was the
                            remark he made regarding America's infinte ability to bounce back and the kind of
                            initiatives that had and
                            were coming
                            into play to drive automation across industries and business processes!! The set up in North
                            Carolina was
                            something he
                            seemed really excited about. However, I was in no mood to take this seriously - I guess, the
                            Offshoring
                            euphoria ( and
                            I was working towards closing one of the largest deals that my company had ever won) and the
                            general sense
                            that our
                            time had come to conquer the world were reasons enough to look askance - and, the wine made
                            it easy!</p>

                        <p>Today, what he was talking about is in our face - and, I have absolute clarity of thought on
                            what the
                            term "myopic
                            vision" implies! And now that we are worrying about singularity and the role of humans
                            visavis robots and
                            even the
                            future and survival of mankind, I tell myself that I will not make the mistake I made in
                            2008 and that
                            rather than
                            reinventing the wheel, I will learn a few things from Nostradamus - after all reuse is key
                            not only to the
                            world of
                            technology but to historians as well!</p>

                        <p>So, what do I see? I see quite a lot of things but most of them are blurred - I am trying my
                            best to
                            focus and at
                            this point of time have one picture that seems to be reasonably sharp!</p>

                        <p>I see a lot of "People Managers", the erstwhile darlings of the IT services industry,
                            struggling to
                            find their raison d'etre in the current paradigm! The very skill that they were rewarded and
                            promoted
                            for i.e. managing people, spreadsheets with KPIs & metrics like bench, utilization, pyramid
                            etc.,
                            creating and reviewing various reports, handling 200+ emails on a daily basis had suddenly
                            gone out of
                            vogue!. In fact, they are being questioned for not reinventing themselves, not being
                            innovative, missing
                            the bus and very far from being the "full stack developers" that the current world requires.
                            How could
                            they be so myopic not to have been at the forefront of the ML, AI & RPA world - after all,
                            they were the
                            leaders the industry relied so heavily upon. Alas, the times they were a changin or had it
                            changed
                            already?</p>
                        <p>Now, what makes matters worse is that a large proportion of these People Managers are
                            experiencing a
                            mid life crisis and have to live with the powers and limitations of the "grown up brain"! A
                            brain that
                            is quite low on "fluid intelligence", a brain that finds picking up new cognitive skills
                            cumbersome and
                            challenging. Challenges should be welcome, but only those battles should be picked up that
                            can be won
                            and esp. if it is a battle for livelihood then it has to be won as there is no other choice
                            but to face
                            damnation! Should these middle aged People Managers strive towards re skilling themselves on
                            the latest
                            technologies which requires high fluid intelligence or should they be doing something else?
                            But, the key
                            questions is there something else and if yes, then what is that "something else"?</p>

                        <p>Before, I come to that "something else", let's look at the strengths of the middle aged brain
                            - a brain
                            that is more
                            balanced in terms of left and right orientation ( dominant left in early youth move towards
                            right and vice
                            versa), a
                            brain that can see patterns easily and quickly and is better at making judgements, finding
                            solutions and
                            even
                            regulating our emotions ( ref. The Secret Life of the Grown Up Brain by Barbara Strauch).
                            So, shouldn't
                            our middle
                            aged People Managers focus on leveraging these strengths rather than focusing on aspects
                            that is best
                            suited for their
                            younger colleagues? Again, this is directional and there are always exceptions/outliers and
                            each has to
                            decide for
                            themselves. My point of bring this up is that there can be alternatives and that not all is
                            lost!!</p>

                        <p>So, what is that "something else"? That "something else" can be visualised as the pyramid
                            below</p>
