                    <div class="bcont">
                        <p>Thomas Kuhn, in his path breaking book “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962)”
                            showed that it
                            takes about 30 years for a new scientific theory to become a new paradigm! Peter Drucker
                            talked about a
                            similar lead time for “new knowledge” to become “knowledge based innovation!
                        </p>
                        <p>Now, eLearning, which definitely fits into the knowledge/scientific theory category, came
                            into being
                            around 1998/1999! So, if we go by Kuhn and Drucker, then there’s 10 more years before e
                            Learning becomes
                            mainstream. However, that was 50+ years ago!! In the era of Industry 4.0, the cycle time
                            should shrink,
                            right? So, we may not have to wait another decade before e Learning becomes mainstream. For
                            all we know,
                            the giant leap may happen in 2019! And, John Lennon may be wrong in calling me a dreamer :-)
                        </p>
                        <p>Both, demand and supply side factors have to be in equilibrium for eLearning to take off!
                            With a large
                            chunk of
                            learners falling into the Digital Native and Millennial category, need for eLearning is not
                            an issue –
                            however, a lot
                            of times the need fails to convert into demand as the rendering doesn’t come close to the
                            way humans
                            typically consume
                            content! Neo age technologies like NLP and Deep Learning as powered by AR/VR/MR are helping
                            create a
                            learning
                            experience pretty close to the way it’d come via a competent and passionate facilitator/
                            educator/
                            trainer. This
                            should solve the problem on the supply side. However, the acceleration in take-off is yet to
                            happen.</p>
                        <p>So, what’s holding things back? The problem is that not enough is happening on the supply
                            side. Two
                            factors that’s
                            thwarting progress:</p>
                        <ul class="ml-4">
                            <li>High Cost</li>
                            <li>Availability of Skilled personnel</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Agreed, that these are genuine factors plaguing the usage of cutting edge technologies in the
                            world of
                            eLearning. However, if I step back and think – this isn’t the first time that an
                            industry/business is
                            experiencing this, right? This has been the case in the “pre take off” stage for every
                            knowledge based
                            innovation. And, they have been solved, pretty much every time! The strategy that has helped
                            is to get as
                            many hands and feet to work on different aspects of the problem – more the action, more the
                            likelihood of
                            positive outcomes. Some of the ways this can be achieved:</p>
                        <ol class="ml-4">
                            <li>Government incentives like tax sops, discounts, infrastructure support etc. to create
                                hot beds</li>
                            <li>Industry bodies creating knowledge sharing forums, rewards etc.</li>
                            <li>Involving multiple agencies - modularizing and componentizing with the intent of
                                outsourcing to
                                multiple entities based on what’s core to them</li>
                            <li>Going beyond national boundaries and leveraging global capabilities esp. countries where
                                cost
                                structures are lower and where skills availability is relatively less of an issue</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Of the above approaches, # 1 moves at its own pace and is difficult to influence at the
                            “individual”
                            level; we require the “collective” to expedite things.</p>
                        <p>One of the collectives is the Industry body (#2 above), which in the case of eLearning has a
                            limited
                            coverage and is not yet mainstream. Few providers and research agencies control the shots –
                            it’s still
                            like a Big Boys club, where most of the Boys come from an era/origin, where technology is
                            not their
                            forte. Hence, the game that’s being played currently has sprinkling of technology but not
                            technology as
                            the mainstay!</p>

                        <p>In my mind, the real hope is with #3 and #4 which can help democratize the dissemination of
                            these
                            technologies in the world of eLearning and thereby help unlock eLearning’s potential for the
                            greater good.
                            These approaches have helped accelerate the take off in every new knowledge based innovation
                            and made them
                            available to the common masses!</p>
                        <p>And here, Corporates can/will lead the way as they have always done in the past. In the VUCA
                            world, there
                            is a strong
                            belief that mindset, personality and behavioral aspects of a Human Resource will be the
                            differentiator in
                            the era of
                            Industry 4.0. For a human resource to be effective and efficient, they have to unlearn and
                            learn really
                            quickly.
                            Learning is already moving out of traditional HR boundaries and moving into/within the folds
                            of business.
                        </p>
                        <p>So, am waiting for the inevitable to happen. As Outsourcing/Offshoring becomes mainstream,
                            elearning
                            adoption has the
                            potential to beat the 30-year cycle, if not by many, then at least by a few years! After
                            all, records have
                            to be
                            broken.</p>
