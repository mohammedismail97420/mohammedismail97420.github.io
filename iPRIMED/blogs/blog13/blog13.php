                    </div>
                    <div class="bdate">
                        <p style="display: inline-block;">Posted on</p>
                        <a rel="bdate">February 9, 2019</a>
                        </span>

                    <div class="bcont">
                        <p>All working professionals, in their careers, would have undergone some kind of compliance
                            training or the
                            other. I won’t be wrong in making this assertion, will I? And most of these training run as
                            eLearning,
                            where learners learn in a self-paced mode.
                        </p>
                        <p>So, what’s the imagery most of us carry when the words “Compliance Training” are flashed
                            before us? Cold
                            and Dreary or Warm and Sunny? A Documentary/Art movie or Commercial cinema? I guess it’s
                            anyone’s guess :)
                        </p>

                        <p>Does it really have to be this way? I don’t think so. Can we change it? My answer is a
                            vehement YES!!</p>

                        <p>So, where do we begin? It’s all in the design or shall we say it’s all in the designer’s
                            mind! Imagine,
                            if the designer is from the fine arts background rather than from an audit/legal/fraud
                            management
                            background? How would the story flow? At least, there’ll be a story for sure!</p>

                        <p>If Compliance Training were to be rendered via a movie, what would the genre be? Both, art
                            cinema and
                            commercial cinema deliver the same message, albeit the approach is very different. Since
                            what reaches the
                            masses is commercial cinema, shouldn’t this be the de facto approach for the majority of
                            employees in a
                            Company? And, of course, there could be the art version, targeted at a much smaller segment.
                            So, looks
                            like we'll require 2 versions! Even better still, if we had a magic wand that could
                            dynamically create a
                            movie somewhere in the “art – commercial cinema” divide, depending on the learner’s
                            preferences. And by
                            the way, let’s not forget that we are dealing with a very important topic for the
                            Corporation – a matter
                            that can significantly impact the top line, bottom line, Company Branding & Goodwill or
                            shall we say the
                            very existence of the Corporation! We also have to keep in mind that like the Censor Board,
                            the Risk &
                            Compliance board has to approve our movie!</p>

                        <p>Do magicians exist? Does anyone have a magic wand? The answer lies somewhere in the surreal
                            and sublime
                            or as Khalil Gibran would say “ in the dawning of our own mind”. And the dawning of my mind
                            tells me that
                            the magician is “Technology”. However, this magician doesn’t understand our audience very
                            well and has to
                            undergo some training/trials to become more effective with an audience who have only seen
                            cold and dreary
                            views - sudden sunshine can overwhelm them which can lead to unhealthy outcomes! The art of
                            subtlety makes
                            things human and technology has to be designed/enabled in a manner that this (subtlety) is
                            not lost –
                            remember, I started off by saying that it’s all in the Design!</p>

                        <p>Imagine the next time you undergo Compliance Training and it runs like a cinema that is
                            absolutely
                            personalised for you ( on the commercial – art cinema divide), wouldn’t all the typical
                            shortcomings of
                            Compliance training go away? Wouldn’t the training be:</p>

                        <p>And finally let me leave you with a thought – shouldn’t all learning be handled in a similar
                            manner?
                            Why a step motherly treatment for others?</p>
