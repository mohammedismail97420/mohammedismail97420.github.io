                        <p>Content is embedded in every business process and in every industry! What may vary is the
                            relevance/impact it has on the execution of the business process. Over the last decade or
                            so, the degree of digitisation of content has increased significantly and it seems to be the
                            way to go. This is good news as dissemination and consumption of information has become
                            easier and more manageable. Omni channel content helps extending the reach across
                            geographies and roles. However, we still have a long way to go before digital content
                            becomes mainstream and is taken seriously by business!
                        </p>
                        <p>One of the big cribs around digital content is that its behaviour is still quite similar to
                            printed text – still very passive with limited interactivity! It doesn’t change it’s
                            rendering/form basis the “consumer” of the content or the changing demands of a business
                            process esp. in a VUCA world! For e.g. as Communication Service Providers (CSPs) become
                            Digital Service Providers (DSPs), telecom networks are becoming more and more programmable.
                            Now, if the network itself is becoming software designed and programmable and where network
                            apps are virtualised and containerised, all supporting assets/artefacts should become
                            programmable as well for smooth execution. Reliance on manual intervention for the changes
                            will result in delays and potential misalignments and confusion across the chain - a huge
                            risk to the business! For e.g. something as simple as "detailed work procedures" will have
                            to change if the network configuration/type changes and if the changes are not done in real
                            time, then it is quite likely that the process will break and outcomes will suffer; can
                            potentially bring the entire business to a halt! While I have painted the case of a DSP,
                            similar scenarios exist in most industries - the key ones being Life Sciences, Automotive,
                            BFSI and Retail.</p>

                        <p>Now, this can be avoided if the content becomes smart and is able to adapt to the changes in
                            the eco system. It's a no brainer that technology will have to power this. However, this is
                            an area that has not seen much focus apart from some work done by DARPA which has still not
                            reached maturity. Attempts are on by various entities, including by Primed Talent, and
                            various algorithms are being tried. While basic adaptiveness has been achieved in the B2C
                            world, it's still a far cry in the B2B /Commercial world as the potential risk to business
                            operations/outcomes thwarts trials. Experiments need to be encouraged on atomic content
                            where advanced NLP, AI and Machine Learning ought to be applied on large volumes of
                            "trained" statistical data to arrive at a potential solution. All this requires, deep
                            pockets and high tolerance for failure - something that is relatively uncommon in the world
                            of Content and esp. in Learning Content! Even large publishers/content houses have shown
                            reluctance to walk the talk.</p>

                        <p>We have the design; waiting for a sponsor to help us take it to market! Anyone interested?
