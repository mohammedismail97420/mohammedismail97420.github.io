                    <div class="bcont">
                        <p>One of the impediments to achieving Agility is the lack of an objective way of measuring L&D
                            Agility. And we all know, that what can't be measured can't be improved!
                        </p>
                        <p>So, here you go - we have created an Agility Index to help L&D ( or for that matter any
                            organisation that has to create & manage Digital Content) organisations on their improvement
                            journey. We have drawn parallels with a modern News Room, where things no longer happen only
                            in
                            a "linear" and planned manner. There is enough and more breaking news and crowd sourced news
                            (
                            one has to be careful of fake news!) being put on air where things happen in a more
                            "spatial"
                            manner.</p>

                        <p>To measure L&D Agility, we need to look at 2 key factors:</p>
                        <ol type="1" class="ml-4">
                            <li>Responsiveness in Planned Situations ( RPS)</li>
                            <li>Responsiveness in Unplanned Situation ( RUS)</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Typically, there is a tradeoff between the above two factors. </p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="1.png" alt="">
                        <p>An organisation which is highly responsive in planned situations (long cycle) finds it
                            difficult
                            to be responsive in ad hoc/unplanned situations and vice versa. The ability to be good in
                            both,
                            without violating the cardinal laws/guiding principles of learning/communication is critical
                            to
                            an organisation being Agile!</p>

                        <p>An organisation's responsiveness can be classified as Low, Medium, High depending on their
                            capability on the Process, Technology & People aspects to be able to be responsive in a
                            consistent, repeatable and predictable manner. Basis these classifications, there are 5
                            levels
                            on the Agility Index</p>
                        <div class="text-center mb-3 mt-3">
                            <img class="img-fluid w-75 text-center" src="2.png" alt="">

                        </div>
                        <p>Since technology has a huge play in driving Agility and esp. for the Unplanned situations,
                            reaching Level 5 may not be practical given where tech developments stand today! Level 4
                            should
                            be a good state to be in. In our experience most L&D organisations are at Level 2, some are
                            at
                            Level 1 and very few at Level 3. We haven't come across any that's at Level 4! A Level 4
                            organisation mirrors a well functioning modern News Room!</p>
                        <p>How do we determine Low/Medium/High in an objective manner? A little bit of arithmetic always
                            helps! Each of the key
                            aspects ( Process, Tech, people) is measured basis 5 key questions each ( total of 15
                            questions)
                            and then the
                            overall score is divided into 3 levels:</p>
                        <ul class="ml-4">
                            <li>Low: less than equal to 5</li>
                            <li>Medium: greater than 5 but less than equal to 10</li>
                            <li>High: greater than 10</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In the interest of brevity, I am skipping further details. Do reach out, if you'd like to
                            know
                            more. Meanwhile, would love to hear our views and reactions to the Index per se. Does it
                            make
                            sense? Does it fill a void? Will you be ok to use the same?</p>
                        <p>And how does an organisation move levels? It's a complex journey where we'll have to work
                            with the old horses - Process, Technology & People! Technology has a big role to play but,
                            one has to be careful so that Tech doesn't drive the process and things stay the other way
                            round! Again, happy to discuss offline unless you'd like to wait for my next article :)</p>
