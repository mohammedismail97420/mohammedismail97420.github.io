                        <p>Have you ever wondered, why even in the 21st century, a father is supposed to be the head of
                            the family?
                            Or a child
                            is still somewhere bound to do what his/her parents wants him/her to do? Or why do we
                            hesitate to take our
                            own
                            decisions independently?</p>
                        <p>Because we've been taught all this since ages and accepted it all as a fact without an
                            inquisitive mind
                            of "WHY?"</p>
                        <p>With rapid mushrooming of colleges/institutions around the country, be it for
                            engineering/BBA/MBA etc,
                            are the kids
                            of our country really getting educated?
                            Well, what is education? Why do we need it? Just to enhance our resume and to somehow get a
                            job doing
                            mundane tasks
                            everyday to fill the pocket of someone who barely knows you? Or to make our own self
                            satisfied that I've
                            done "higher
                            studies" and am now known to be a well qualified person in the society!!</p>

                        <p>The world is changing and we cannot afford to be on the back seat. The time has come to break
                            these
                            strands of
                            unknown rituals, being followed since ages, and understand what education actually is and
                            how Indian
                            education system
                            and Indian mentality on it needs a "revamp"!</p>

                        <p>Why was Newton the only one to question the falling of an apple while all others just watched
                            it falling?
                            Because all
                            others accepted it to be "like that only"! We are still like that frog who thinks the well
                            is the only
                            world, nothing
                            beyond it! We need to come out of it and explore the world with the right knowledge and
                            right know-how!
                        </p>

                        <p>Sitting in a 4 walled room and learning algebra on a white board is not bad, but it's equally
                            true that
                            this 4 walled
                            learning is not enough to fetch you a perfect job! A more focus based approach is what we
                            need to adopt.
                            An approach
                            where Java/C++ comes up in the shell of core skills. India's demographic dividend can be
                            reaped
                            efficiently only if we
                            focus on skilling the massive youth population on their core skills and make them more job
                            ready. Only
                            then can we
                            reap the exact potential. Textbooks and white-boards are good to teach you the concepts but
                            it won't teach
                            you how to
                            deal with ambiguity, how to generate curiosity, how to manage your anger/stress, how to be
                            effective in
                            communication,
                            how to be more professional, because all these are the "out of the well" things, which needs
                            to be built
                            and
                            developed. And these skills are not just important for our professional life but also
                            personal.</p>

                        <p>So friends, let's not just be qualified, let's get educated! Let's see the world with a lens
                            beyond
                            textbook
                            learning. Let's all try and keep the myelin on fire today, tomorrow and forever and make
                            this world a
                            better place to
                            live in!</p>
