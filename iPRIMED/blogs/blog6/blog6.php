                        <p>Most of my friends on the business side who have employed a campus hire from IIMs complain of
                            the
                            mismatch between
                            the expectation and actual performance of the recent hire. A typical, IIM graduate thinks
                            they know it all
                            and doesn’t
                            want to get in the trenches and get their hands dirty. Their expectation is to be a manager
                            after the
                            prestigious IIM
                            degree. They expect a rosy, cushy and secure job where everything will be laid out for them
                            and that they
                            will get all
                            the perks that come with it, like traveling abroad and so on. It takes a while for them to
                            come to terms
                            with reality
                            and that’s why most of them are not able to hold on to their first job for more than 12
                            months.</p>

                        <p>After an 18 month grind post IIMB, where I am involved in solving employability at scale, I
                            strongly
                            believe that
                            B-schools in their current form and shape have become redundant for corporates to hire from.
                        </p>
                        <p>I am questioning both the selection and transformation process of students at IIMs. If it’s
                            garbage in
                            then it will
                            be garbage out. If more folks are selected who just use IIM as a placement agency then basic
                            existence of
                            the
                            transformation process at IIMs is challenged.</p>

                        <p>A typical curriculum at IIMs focuses on imparting a whole lot of direct
                            (functional/technical) skills in
                            various business functions like strategy, HR, marketing and so on. I urge all of you to take
                            a moment to
                            reflect back on the skills required to do your professional work. Do you really require an
                            MBA degree to
                            do the work you are doing today? Today in the Volatile, Uncertain, Ambiguous & Complex
                            (VUCA) world – what
                            you and I require to succeed is a mixture of some direct skill related to our job and a
                            whole lot of
                            behavioural/soft skills. Rather than calling the latter as soft skills, we call them “Core”
                            skills as it
                            is core to every human irrespective of the job/function esp. in the VUCA world! While
                            multiple core skills
                            are required and the importance of a particular core skill varies based on the business
                            situation we are
                            in, some generic core skills always hold. Pro-activeness, Openness, Curiosity & Perseverance
                            are the four
                            shields in the VUCA world – none of which are taught in classrooms. So if it’s just a matter
                            of learning
                            direct skills, then with MOOCs of the world - can’t the relevant and best of direct skills
                            be picked up?
                            And with regards to core skills - students currently pick up many of these skills through
                            the various
                            extra-curricular activities. A good time to do these extra-curricular activities is in the
                            more formative
                            years of school (K12) rather than under/post grad days where a lot more unlearning is
                            required making the
                            outcomes more risky! So then what remains of the B-schools – the best of the direct skills
                            can be picked
                            up through various online channels – and classrooms don’t impart core skills. So then are
                            B-schools
                            producing the right output for the corporates to hire?</p>


                        <p>At iPRIMED while we skill the world, we skill our colleagues first. We have handpicked
                            intelligent kids
                            with the
                            right core skills from various NITs and imparted them the relevant direct skills. I can
                            boast that in few
                            months’ time
                            with iPRIMED they will be better than most IIM campus hires. So while you decide whether or
                            not to do that
                            campus
                            hiring at IIM, we @iPRIMED might have just cracked the model for you</p>
