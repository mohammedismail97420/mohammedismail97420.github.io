                        <p>I remember my teenage years – it was spent cramming up textbooks and spending sleepless
                            nights. I
                            sacrificed play,
                            entertainment, social outings – virtually everything to score some extra marks in exams.
                            Today a decade
                            after I
                            finished my schooling, nothing has changed. Kids, teenagers – everyone who is in the proper
                            formal
                            education system is
                            either being pulled or pushed to study more and more - just to score some additional marks.
                        </p>
                        <p>The situation is worse for students in 10th, 11th & 12th classes. They just keep shuffling
                            between
                            either the demands of their school or the pressure from their coaching institutes. Added to
                            that is the
                            peer pressure, coercing from parents & the fear of failure.</p>
                        <p>And where does all that lead to? Most end up joining an engineering college and a few end up
                            joining
                            medical
                            colleges. And after all this, 90% end up being unemployable. The reasons for unemployability
                            are many but
                            let’s take a
                            moment to think – does it require us to go through the grind of 16 years in academia to do
                            what we are
                            doing today? Do
                            most of us require the knowledge of refraction or the understanding of organic bonds or the
                            knowledge of
                            tricks to
                            solve the corner cases of differential calculus – in doing our regular jobs?</p>


                        <p>With technology transforming the world in myriad ways, the need to reproduce information with
                            memory is
                            not relevant
                            anymore. All factual information is available with a single touch or even voice based
                            search. The pace of
                            change in
                            today’s industries and technology is increasing with every passing day. When we come out of
                            the formal
                            education
                            system 20 years after we had entered it – the whole world just changed in those two decades
                            and most of
                            what we would
                            have studied is not relevant anymore. So as an employer what then is really important to me
                            in the
                            candidate is their
                            ability to learn, unlearn and learn again. In current scheme of things for most of the jobs,
                            a candidate
                            just needs
                            the following basic skills – intelligence, digital literacy and soft skills (but we call the
                            soft skills
                            as core
                            skills as these are core to every human irrespective of the job/function). And do we really
                            require 16
                            years of
                            education system to pick these set of skills? Hence what I am proposing is that - what
                            really matters is
                            the skills
                            and not a formal education.</p>


                        <p>The question therefore I ask is that – Is sacrificing childhood and stressing out teenage
                            years’ worth
                            the effort?
                            Can’t these formative years be used to pick different life skills and direct
                            (functional/technical) skills
                            worth the
                            kid’s interest and perhaps we could have had a much more employable person and without a 16
                            year formal
                            education
                            grind.
                        </p>
