                            well?</p>

                        <p>A little bit of History always helps to put things in perspective! The need for "trained
                            freshers in
                            large numbers" was required for the first time in the 1990s by the burgeoning IT industry.
                            Fulfilment was
                            a challenge as the supply of these skills from our academia was limited, probably as there
                            was no demand
                            for such large numbers till date ( chicken and egg situation!). Large IT services companies
                            solved this
                            situation by running training programs in house, post hiring the freshers. They made
                            significant
                            investments in this area as there was no other option. With the pressure to put these
                            resources to
                            production as soon as possible, these companies focused on the bare minimum and what was
                            required for the
                            jobs of that era ( more commodity work - onions & potatoes work rather than full meals and
                            fine dining!).
                            The growth was so rapid that no one had the time to look ahead and ensure that these
                            academies ( also,
                            called Universities by quite a handful!) stayed abreast with the aspirations & demands of
                            the future.</p>
                        <p>Proliferation of in house training ( and of course, hiring untrained freshers) created jobs
                            in the
                            training & hiring
                            space within these IT companies; including hands and feet required to run the infrastructure
                            of these
                            large training
                            centres. The focus was mostly inwards - dealing with internal stakeholders and not much
                            focus/interactions
                            with the
                            external world - the world of customers/markets/competition. This was not core to the
                            business of these
                            companies (
                            was on the cost side of the profit equation). The natural outcomes was inertia setting in
                            resulting in a
                            lack of
                            "future orientation" and an the creation of an insular mindset. External developments,
                            innovative
                            approaches somehow
                            did not make headway with the bulwarks of the hiring & training departments within these
                            organisations.

                        <p>As technology's ability to disrupt businesses became mainstream in the last decade or so, the
                            players in
                            the IT/ITeS industry embraced the "talk" but not "walking the talk"! The space was abuzz
                            with technology's
                            ability to transform business and the fact that IT companies should try and get a big chunk
                            of this pie
                            from their customer's wallet. Some of them did (remember, we were good with the "talk") get
                            a significant
                            chunk - however, most failed to execute as the talent supply chain was still geared to
                            deliver yesterday's
                            business and with freshers contributing to 50% - 70% of their workforce and worse still,
                            their enablement
                            process still rooted in the 1990s era, disaster was looming large.</p>

                        <p>While I have taken the example of the IT/ITeS industry; other sectors in the services space
                            are dealing
                            with similar
                            issues, though to a lesser degree.</p>

                        <p>Attempts were and are still being made by Skilling firms to disrupt the space and ensure
                            current demands
                            are met
                            while staying tuned with future developments. It is easy to understand that this is "core"
                            to these firms.
                            Significant
                            progress has been made by some of them - however, this is still not mainstream!</p>
                        <p>There are many versions of the HTD model in the market. The play is mostly on "H" and "D" and
                            the slants
                            are done
                            based on who is designing them - typically, with the intent of win - lose! Here is a look at
                            some of the
                            models in the
                            HTD space at play:</p>

                        <div class="text-center mt-3 mb-3">
                            <img class="img-fluid w-75" src="2.jpg" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <p>And, the models compared on some key dimensions:</p>
                        <div class="text-center mt-3 mb-3">
                            <img class="img-fluid w-75" src="3.jpg" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <p>So, wouldn't you agree that it's a no brainer that as to which option should be chosen? I am
                            sure, it
                            can't be that
                            difficult...</p>


                        <p>Now, that we have an idea of the model that can help deliver quality at scale, here is a
                            quick look at
                            the steps to make this successful - who should be doing what and more importantly, what is
                            it that should
                            not be done!</p>

                            This has already become a long article. I will stop here as I have done my share of talking
                            on the
                            happening
                            yet elusive
                            HTD model with a request for others to join the conversation and make this a movement that
                            will deliver
                            the
                            greatest
                            good for the greatest numbers...
